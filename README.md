# SC25-VGC

This repository is for AD/AE process for SC'25 accepted paper "GPU Lossy Compression for HPC Can Be Versatile and Ultra-fast".


## 1. Introduction

VGC is an error-bounded lossy compression library specifically designed for NVIDIA GPUs to compress floating-point data.
This repository is for SC'25 AD/AE process.
The official and final version of VGC will be updated into cuSZp repository [[LINK](https://github.com/szcompressor/cuSZp)].
For simplicity, we will still use the name VGC in this repository, to align with what is reported in the submission version.
In short, this repository contains three sections:
- **2. Configuring VGC and Datasets**: In this section, reviewer can check software/hardware dependencies, compile VGC to executable binaries, and set up HPC datasets evaluated in the original paper.
- **3. Reproducing Main Evaluation Results**: In this section, reviewer can reproduce main paper results that are related to the key metrics of VGC compressor, including throughput, compression ratios, and versatility.
- **4. (Optional) Other Evaluation Results**: In this section, reviewer can selectively reproduce other results lie in discussion/case study sections. Note that this section contains extra environment and datasets setups.
